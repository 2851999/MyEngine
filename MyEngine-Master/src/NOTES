NOTES DEVELOPMENT VERSION

VSync if changed from initial value will require the engine
to be restarted for the change to be applied.

Turning OpenGL on/off will require the engine to restart also

Both types of window have a FPS limiting device. The one in
the Java Window is not as accurate. By setting the MAX_FPS
variable to 0 the FPS will not be limited.
